# Active Context - Mark as Read Feature Implementation

## Current Work Focus

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive "mark as read" feature for the LinkedIn messaging application. This feature allows users to mark conversations as read from both the sidebar and within the chat interface.

## Recent Changes (Just Completed)

### 1. **Unipile API Integration**
- **File**: `src/types/unipile-api.ts`
- **Changes**: Added `UnipileApiPatchChatRequest` and `UnipileApiPatchChatResponse` types
- **Purpose**: Support for PATCH `/chats/{chat_id}` endpoint to mark chats as read

### 2. **UnipileService Enhancement**
- **File**: `src/services/unipile/unipile.service.ts`
- **Changes**: Added `patchChat()` method
- **Purpose**: Handles communication with Unipile's PATCH chat endpoint
- **Features**: Supports marking chats as read, muting, archiving, etc.

### 3. **Database Service Updates**
- **File**: `src/services/db/unipile-chat.service.ts`
- **Changes**: Added `markChatAsRead()` and `updateUnreadCount()` methods
- **Purpose**: Local database updates for read status management

### 4. **TRPC API Endpoint**
- **File**: `src/server/api/routers/inbox.ts`
- **Changes**: Added `markChatAsRead` mutation
- **Purpose**: Full-stack endpoint that updates both Unipile and local database
- **Security**: Validates user ownership of chats

### 5. **Sidebar Context Menu**
- **File**: `src/components/inbox-sidebar.tsx`
- **Changes**: Added dropdown context menu with "Mark as read" option
- **Features**: 
  - Shows unread indicator dots
  - Context menu appears on hover
  - Only shows "Mark as read" for unread chats
  - Toast notifications for success/error
  - Automatic UI refresh after marking as read

### 6. **Chat Page Integration**
- **File**: `src/app/(app)/inbox/[chatId]/page.tsx`
- **Changes**: Added "Mark as read" button in chat header
- **Features**:
  - Only visible for chats with unread messages
  - Disabled state during processing
  - Integrated with same TRPC mutation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. **User Action**: Click "Mark as read" in sidebar or chat view
2. **TRPC Mutation**: Calls `markChatAsRead` with chatId
3. **Permission Check**: Verifies user owns the chat
4. **Unipile Update**: Calls PATCH `/chats/{external_id}` with `action: "mark_as_read"`
5. **Database Update**: Sets `unread_count = 0` in local database
6. **UI Refresh**: Refetches chat data to update visual indicators

### Error Handling
- Validates chat ownership before processing
- Handles Unipile API failures gracefully
- Shows user-friendly error messages via toast notifications
- Proper TRPC error codes for different failure scenarios

### UI/UX Features
- **Visual Indicators**: Blue dots show unread status in sidebar
- **Context Menus**: Right-click style interactions for chat actions
- **Loading States**: Disabled buttons and loading text during processing
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Current Status

âœ… **COMPLETED**: Full mark as read functionality
- Both sidebar and chat page implementations
- Database and Unipile API synchronization
- Error handling and user feedback
- UI indicators and loading states

## Next Steps

The mark as read feature is fully functional and ready for testing. Users can now:
1. Mark chats as read from the sidebar context menu
2. Mark chats as read from within the chat interface
3. See visual indicators for unread chats
4. Receive feedback on successful/failed operations

## Technical Notes

- Uses proper TypeScript types throughout the stack
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- Integrates seamlessly with existing TRPC and Prisma setup
- Maintains data consistency between Unipile and local database
- Proper error boundaries and user feedback mechanisms
