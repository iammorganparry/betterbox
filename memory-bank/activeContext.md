# Active Context - Attachment Download Implementation

## Current Work Focus

We have successfully implemented attachment download functionality using the Unipile API to retrieve base64 content for message attachments. This allows the application to store and display attachment content locally rather than relying on external URLs.

## Recent Changes (Just Completed)

### 1. **Database Schema Enhancement**
- **File**: `src/db/schema/tables2.ts`
- **Changes**: Added `content` field to `unipileMessageAttachments` table
- **Purpose**: Store base64 encoded attachment content locally
- **Migration**: Applied via `db:push` to avoid migration conflicts
- **Type Safety**: Content field automatically included in service types through schema inference

### 2. **Unipile Service API Extension**
- **File**: `src/services/unipile/unipile.service.ts`
- **New Method**: `getMessageAttachment(messageId, attachmentId, accountId?)`
- **Functionality**: Downloads attachment content as base64 string using Unipile API
- **API Endpoint**: `GET /messages/{message_id}/attachments/{attachment_id}`
- **Response Handling**: Supports both plain base64 and data URL formats
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and graceful error recovery
- **MIME Type Detection**: Extracts MIME type from data URLs when available

### 3. **Real-time Attachment Processing**
- **File**: `src/services/inngest/unipile-sync.ts`
- **Function**: `_handleMessageReceived` - Enhanced with content download
- **Process Flow**:
  1. Process attachment metadata from webhook
  2. Download base64 content using `getMessageAttachment`
  3. Store both metadata and content in database
  4. Graceful fallback if download fails
- **Logging**: Comprehensive attachment processing logs
- **Performance**: Downloads only when attachment ID is available and not unavailable

### 4. **Historical Sync Enhancement**
- **File**: `src/services/inngest/unipile-sync.ts` 
- **Function**: `unipileHistoricalMessageSync` - Enhanced existing attachment processing
- **Improvement**: Added content download to historical message sync
- **Consistency**: Same download logic as real-time processing
- **Backward Compatibility**: Works with existing attachment metadata
- **Efficiency**: Processes attachments during bulk historical sync

### 5. **Error Handling & Resilience**
- **Strategy**: Non-blocking attachment downloads
- **Fallback**: Save metadata even if content download fails
- **Logging**: Detailed success/failure logging for debugging
- **Performance**: Continues processing other attachments on individual failures
- **User Experience**: No impact on message sync if attachment download fails

## Current Status

✅ **COMPLETED**: Attachment Download Implementation
- Database schema enhanced with content field for base64 storage
- Unipile service extended with `getMessageAttachment` method
- Real-time message processing downloads attachment content
- Historical sync enhanced to process attachment content
- Comprehensive error handling and logging implemented
- Both webhook and API-based attachment processing supported

✅ **COMPLETED**: Full LinkedIn Messaging Integration
- Complete message synchronization (real-time + historical)
- Attachment metadata and content storage
- Contact enrichment and profile syncing
- Chat organization and management
- Read status and message state tracking

## Technical Implementation Details

### New Components Added
- **Database Field**: `content` column in `unipileMessageAttachments` table for base64 storage
- **API Method**: `getMessageAttachment()` in UnipileService for content retrieval  
- **Download Logic**: Integrated into both real-time and historical sync processes
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and graceful fallback mechanisms

### Enhanced Data Flow
- **Real-time**: Webhook → Process metadata → Download content → Store in DB
- **Historical**: API sync → Process metadata → Download content → Store in DB
- **Fallback**: Metadata always saved even if content download fails
- **Performance**: Non-blocking downloads maintain sync speed

### Architecture Benefits
- **Complete Attachment Support**: Both metadata and content stored locally
- **Resilient Processing**: Graceful handling of download failures
- **Consistent Experience**: Same logic for real-time and historical sync
- **Future Ready**: Foundation for attachment viewing and management features

## Next Steps

The attachment download implementation is complete. The application now provides:
1. **Complete attachment storage** with both metadata and base64 content
2. **Resilient sync processing** that handles attachment download failures gracefully
3. **Consistent data handling** across real-time and historical sync processes
4. **Foundation for attachment features** like inline viewing and file downloads

Future development should focus on:
- Frontend attachment display components
- File type specific viewers (images, documents, etc.)
- Attachment download/export functionality
- Attachment search and filtering capabilities

## Technical Notes

- Attachment content stored as base64 in PostgreSQL text field
- MIME type detection from both API metadata and data URL formats
- Non-blocking downloads ensure message sync continues even if attachments fail
- Comprehensive logging for debugging attachment processing issues
- Database schema automatically includes new content field in TypeScript types
